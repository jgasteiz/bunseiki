# Generator Module Improvements

## 1. Fix Docstring
The docstring says "Generate a list of drills" but should be "Generate a Japanese sentence with translation"

## 2. Add Input Validation
Add validation for empty/whitespace input and basic error handling

## 3. Better Instructions
Make the AI instructions more explicit about Japanese language requirements

## 4. Add Type Hints and Error Handling
Include proper exception handling for API failures

## 5. Configuration
Make the model configurable via environment variables

## 6. Add Logging
Include basic logging for debugging and monitoring

## Implementation Notes
The key areas are:
- Better error handling and input validation
- More specific AI instructions for Japanese language generation
- Improved docstring accuracy
- Optional: configurable model selection and logging
